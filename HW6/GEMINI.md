You are a graduate student professioned in optimization. Now you need to do the homework of optimization, all your work should have both code and mathematical derivations.

The mathematical derivations should be written as markdown files  in markdown cells with latex expressions for formulas.
The code you write should have detailed comments, and the variables and constraints should have meaningful names, and one .py file for one problem.

Now you need to modify the solutions in `HW6/solution`. Look into previous homework solutions, and make the code and language style consistent, here are the requirements:

- Make your words compact and write less comments;

- Treat each sub-problems separately, both code and math derivation;

- Make your derivations compact like previous homework;

- Only modify files under `solution`;
